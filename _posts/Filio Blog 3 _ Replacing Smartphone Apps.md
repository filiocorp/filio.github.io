 **Filio replaces 8 smartphone apps. (here’s how)**

Whether you’re an engineer on-site, in the office, or working from home, keeping track of project visuals is crucial. 

Your smartphone is something you can’t live without on the job - you need to take photos, store them, update your team, create project notes, send out emails… oh, and generate new reports for the company stakeholders!

It’s a good thing you have this technology sitting in your back pocket. But there’s an even better way - Filio’s all-in-one photo & video management system. 

Need to share onsite photos? Add finger drawings or field notes? Notify your team of a sudden change? 

Use Filio. There’s no need to juggle between multiple apps on your smartphone. In fact, with just one download, Filio replaces eight smartphone apps in an instant. Here’s how.

8 Smartphone Apps Filio Can Replace For Engineers

1) **Camera**

Integrate 360-degree Ricoh cameras to enhance your project knowledge and reporting abilities. We make it super easy to capture photos, videos, panoramas, and depth images, so you can document your projects in a snap. 

So far, Filio has been used to take over 65,000 visuals!

1) **Photos**

Living in fear of the dreaded “Phone storage is full” pop-up? Not anymore. Keep all visual data in a central hub with the app. 

Plus, Filio.io uses artificial intelligence to automatically label engineering project images - keeping them organized and easy-to-search when you need them! 

No endless scrolling required.

1) **Email**

Let us guess: You still use email to attach project images + videos and update your team. Good luck searching through your inbox. (We think Jim might have sent it under the wrong thread, anyway - oops. )

To avoid this nightmare, use Filio to manage all your project visual assets in one place. Then, utilize our feature to create real-time updates & field notes, so everyone stays in the loop. 

1) **Notes & Voice Memos**

While your Notes app may be better than post-it notes, legal pads, and papers, your engineering team can ditch it too. 

Use Filio to convert voice notes to text and finger-draw virtually anything on your pictures.

1) **Cloud Storage** 

Never lose critical project assets again. Easily import and export photos, videos, and visual data to the cloud using various platforms - including OneDrive, Google Drive, and Dropbox.

1) **Object Measurement**

Use this high-tech Filio feature to directly measure objects in your pictures, without the need of modifying the image scale. Then annotate your photos with the necessary angles and dimensions.

1) **Maps**

Did you know our built-in GIS and Google Maps integration provides additional geospatial context without any extra effort? 

Capture the geographical location and direction of your  photos and videos. Later, layouts & blueprints can function as interactive maps to geo-reference your project visuals.

1) **Reporting** 

Finally, collaborate with your clients by creating customizable, dynamic, and shareable engineering project reports. 

With the Filio™ platform, you can also generate PDF photo logs of your project assets to share with stakeholders. Annotate images, add project maps, and even request custom template designs.

Replacing these eight smartphone apps isn’t the only thing Filio can do for your engineering team. 

Filio is full of dozens of other features that can make managing your projects’ visuals a breeze - saving your company time and money.
