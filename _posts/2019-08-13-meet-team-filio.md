The story of Filio originates in Atlanta, GA. Founder Mahdi Roozbahani (pictured right) and co-founder Fikret Atalay (pictured left) met at Georgia Institute of Technology while working on their PhD degrees. Though they worked for the same academic advisor, Mahdi's degree was focused on computational science and engineering, while Fikret's degree was focused on civil (geotechnical) engineering. Through their interactions over the years, Mahdi and Fikret saw the need for a better mobile and web-based visual asset management platform, and Filio was born. Filio was then  selected for participation in the prestigious Create-X startup incubator at Georgia Tech, and as the saying goes, the rest is history.
