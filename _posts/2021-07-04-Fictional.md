**An Engineer’s Day in The Life With Filio (The Smart Way)**

Jacob Langwood is a civil engineer who uses Filio daily on company projects. Why? Because this all-in-one SaaS app lets him simplify image & video documentation - cutting down on project timelines, wasted hours, and unnecessary communication with his team.

This is what a typical workday for Langwood looks like. 

At 9 am, he checks his company email for any new updates. This is super quick to do because his inbox doesn't have long threads filled with project assets, like field notes or image attachments. Any critical images, blueprints, maps, and videos are all safely stored in the cloud using the Filio app. 

Jacob doesn't even have to scroll through his phone to find this visual metadata; it's automatically labeled and categorized for easy searching. This also means no fumbling through papers or desktop files!

Next, Jacob remembers that permits need to be submitted later this week, so he begins putting together the necessary calculation package and structural drawings. He'll also need to coordinate with the architect and contractor to get the final footing elevations for this project, too. 

If Jacob needs to reference onsite images from the office or while working from home, he can with Filio. And thanks to voice-to-text notes and freestyle drawing features, there's no confusion about why the logged photos were taken. 

Jacob confirms those measurements in record time - all before his lunch break!

After lunch, he meets with the engineering team to coordinate their tasks. Langwood wants to ensure they stay on track with project timelines, so he asks his team members to document their progress with photos and videos. 

Filio allows anyone on the field to create real-time updates on-site and share them with their project manager or team members. 

Jacob feels confident that he can provide documentation for clients if needed (and for the company’s legal team should a dispute arise). The integrated 360° Rioch photos will also enhance his project knowledge and reporting abilities.

` `In addition, a single project can take several months or years until completion - good thing Jacob can compare before and after photos from any point in the timeline! Plus, with Filio, his team is never limited on the number of visual assets taken. Unlike a smartphone, the cloud (whether you choose Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive) won’t run out of data storage.

Later, Jacob starts on some engineering design work for a parking structure in the city. 

Today, he needs to make some preliminary calculations and verify beam designs. He speeds things up by using Filio’s object measurement tool, which lets him directly measure objects in his pictures, without needing to modify the image scale. 

When finished, he adds both to the structural drawings and blueprints. These blueprints can be imported directly into the Filio app and used in conjunction with a GIS photo map; it analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes. 

Jacob will then be able to georeference onsite photos and videos in an interactive map. *Bonus: This Filio feature can also be reverse engineered, so Langwood uses the map to quickly find pictures in his visual library!*

Finally, Jacob has to collaborate and communicate project details/documentation to corporate bosses, company stakeholders, and the marketing & sales teams. 

He uses Filio to create customized, dynamic reports to share with everyone in the company. (Oh, and he can’t forget the clients, too!) The best part is, the shared report links are dynamic as well - no need to resend or recreate links for every update. 

Since everyone is kept in the loop, miscommunication is rare. Stakeholders are content (and a tad impressed) they can keep eyes on the team’s project remotely. And Jacob is glad multiple departments won’t flag him down with project questions as he’s trying to leave the office!

At 6 pm, Jacob Langwood heads home for the evening to spend time with his family and friends. 

Thanks to Filio, everything is running smoothly, and Jacob knows he can rely on the mobile app to work as hard as he and his team do… day in and day out.

Be like Jacob.
